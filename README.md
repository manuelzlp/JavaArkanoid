## Java Arkanoid!

Hello! I had to finish this really fast, so consider it a incomplete version.

This is just a Java clone of classic Arkanoid.

Inside mon/game/, I wrote some libraries to manage sprites, scroll, collisions and sound. I'm still working on these libraries so this is just another practice project. I hope you can find some useful code inside it!

To run the game on Windows, just run Play.bat

Otherwise, go to ./compiled/ and run the command java App
